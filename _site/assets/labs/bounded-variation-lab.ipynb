    "As in the analogous problem we discussed when doing monotone regression, both our squared error and our constraint depend only on the values $m(X_1) \\ldots m(X_n)$ of $m$. And if we have the values $\\hat\\mu^{\\text{sample}}(X_1) \\ldots \\hat\\mu^{\\text{sample}}(X_n)$ of a solution to this problem, we can easily find a solution to our original problem. In fact, you already have code to do it. Let me explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## From Bounded Variation on the Sample to Bounded Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is that we can take $\\hat \\mu(x)$ to be any curve that agrees with $\\hat \\mu^{\\text{sample}}$ at $X_1 \\ldots X_n$, is *monotone* between the observations, and is *constant* outside the range of the data. Typically, we use piecewise-constant interpolation, defining $\\hat \\mu(x)$ to be $\\hat \\mu^{\\text{sample}}(X_i)$ where $X_i$ is the closest observation to the left of $x$ if $x$ is inside the range of the data and the leftmost observation otherwise: $X_i=\\max\\ \\{X_i : X_i \\le x\\} \\cup \\{X_1\\}$. That's what the function `predict.piecewise.constant` we've been using with monotone regression does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why this gives us a solution to our original problem. The explanation is based on three observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Any curve we're considering in our original optimization also gets considered in our finite-dimensional analog. That is, $\\hat\\rho_{TV}(m) \\le \\rho_{TV}(m)$ for any curve $m$ and therefore $$ \\left\\{ m : \\rho_{TV}(m) \\le B\\right\\} \\subseteq \\left\\{ m : \\hat\\rho_{TV}(m) \\le B \\right\\} $$ We know this because $\\hat\\rho_{TV}(m)$ is the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\left\\lvert m(X_{i+1})-m(X_i) \\right\\rvert$ for a particular increasing sequence $X_1 \\ldots X_n$ and $\\rho_{TV}(m)$ the maximum of *the same sum* over all increasing sequences $X_1 \\ldots X_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  This implies that any curve $\\hat\\mu$ that solves our original optimization would be considered in our finite-dimensional analog, so the prediction error that we're minimizing in both problems, $\\text{MSPE}(m)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\{ Y_i - m(X_i) \\}^2$, is *at least as small* at a solution $\\hat\\mu_{\\text{sample}}$ to the finite-dimensional version as it is in the original problem. Consequently, if a solution $\\hat\\mu_{\\text{sample}}$ to our finite-dimensional problem satisfies the stronger constraint $\\rho_{TV}(m) \\le B$ needed to be considered in the original problem, it's also a solution to the original problem: it has the smallest $\\text{MSPE}$ among curves in the set $\\left\\{ m : \\hat\\rho_{TV}(m) \\le B \\right\\}$, so it must have the smallest $\\text{MSPE}$ among any subset of those curves, including $\\left\\{ m : \\rho_{TV}(m) \\le B \\right\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  For any curve $m^{\\text{sample}}$, we can find a curve $m$ that *agrees on the sample*, i.e. with $m(X_i) = m^{\\text{sample}}(X_i)$, that has total variation *equal to* its sample total variation. The piecewise-constant curve we've been drawing is one of them: all of its variation is at the sample points. Furthermore, because it agrees with $m^{\\text{sample}}$ on the sample, it has the same $\\text{MSPE}$. That means the piecewise-constant curve we've proposed through the points $\\hat\\mu^{\\text{sample}}(X_i)$ is a solution to the finite-dimensional problem and satisfies the stronger constraint imposed in the original problem. Thus, it's a solution to the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reinforce your understanding of this argument, do this exercise. We'll work with a sample of three points $(X_i,Y_i)$. $$ \\left\\{\\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right), \\left(\\frac{1}{2},0\\right), \\left(1,\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\right\\} $$You can think of what we'll be doing as stepping through our approach to bounded variation regression in a world in which there are only six curves: $m_1(x)=x^2$, $m_2(x) = 3(x-1/2)^2$, $m_3(x) = 2(x-3/4)^2$, and corresponding piecewise-constant curves $\\tilde m_1$, $\\tilde m_2$, and $\\tilde m_3$\n"
