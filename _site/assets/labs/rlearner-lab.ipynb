    "## The R-Learner Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine, for a moment, that you know $\\pi(x)$ and $\\beta(x)$. Using\n",
    "Robinson's decomposition, we see that this implies that if we know\n",
    "$\\tau(x)$, then we know $\\mu(w,x)$ and vice-versa. \n",

    "- It's often the case that you know $\\pi$, as if you're an experimenter randomizing treatment,\n",
    "it's part of your experimental design.\n",
    "- It's essentially never the case that you know $\\beta(x)$, but just go with it for now. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because $\\tau(x)=\\mu(1,x)-\\mu(0,x)$, estimating it has got to boil down to some\n",
    "way of estimating $\\mu$, and that's what the R-Learner does. But to do\n",
    "it, it uses a clever model for $\\mu$ that takes advantage of our\n",
    "knowledge of $\\pi$ and $\\beta$. In particular, because we'd know $\\mu$\n",
    "if we knew $\\tau$ (in addition to $\\pi$ and $\\beta$), we use a model\n",
    "that expresses $\\mu(w,x)$ as a function of $\\tau(x)$ and known\n",
    "quantities. Given a model $\\mathcal{M}_\\tau$ meant to contain $\\tau$,\n",
    "this is what our model for $\\mu$ looks like.\n",

    "$$\n",

    "question of how accurate the estimator $\\hat\\tau$ into two parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The question of how close the estimator we actually use is to the oracle estimator.\n",
    "2. The question of how close the oracle estimator is to the actual treatment effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "That amounts to thinking of our estimator $\\hat\\tau$'s error as a sum of two terms.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "People often talk about conditions under which the first term is much smaller than the second, \n",
    "so we can think of the actual and oracle estimators as being essentially the same. It turns \n",
    "out that you don't need to estimate $\\beta$ or $\\pi$ particularly well for this to happen, \n",
