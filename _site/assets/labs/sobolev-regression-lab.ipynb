Exercise 3 asks you to prove that this is the best approximation to $m$ spanned by $\\phi_0, \\ldots, \\phi_{N-1}$ and calculate the error of this approximation. Let's do both at once by looking at the squared error of an arbitrary function $a_N = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} a_j \\phi_j$ spanned by this truncated basis.\n",
